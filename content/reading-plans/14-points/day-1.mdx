# Introduction to The 14 Points for Management

## The Control Panel for Transformation

Imagine for a moment if you could install a machine that could almost instantly begin to improve and transform the quality not only of your products and services, but also that of the thinking of everyone in the organization?

Further, imagine when you set it up you see that it is a control panel with fourteen knobs on it, each labeled differently with a "0" to the left and "∞" (infinity) on the right. The instruction manual says that by turning the knobs to the right, you will begin to effect changes in your organization almost immediately, but at a cost of some intellectual and physical effort from everyone. Moreover, each knob's effects are not independent: some will affect others, but over the long-term **will** improve the quality of your products and services while creating conditions to stay in business and grow, guaranteed.

Would you want such a device? What would you pay for it? To what end would you use it?

In this study plan, we'll learn about Dr. W.E. Deming's practical advice to leadership and top-management on how they can create their own marvelous quality improvement machines that he called *The 14 Points for Management.* Together, they form the basis for directed actions to take, each supported by good theory, to transform the way organizations and businesses are led with a view toward ever-improved quality, productivity, and competitive standing.

## What's Ahead

Over the next 14 days, we'll explore each point in depth, exploring what they ask of us to do, why, and to what end. Through them you will come to understand what Dr. Deming called "profound knowledge" by challenging your own hidden assumptions about "good management", and what could be done instead.

## Reflection Questions

1. **Think about improvement initiatives you've experienced or witnessed.** How many began with a changes in the way top-management lead themselves? What observable changes occurred? Did they last?

2. **Dr. Deming would ask his clients and students two questions:** First, *"Where do you want to be in five years?"* and second, *"By what method would you achieve this?"* Suppose you have hired him to help your leadership team; how would you answer him? 

## Daily Challenge

**Audit your assumptions:**

Before you begin the 14 Points journey, write down your current beliefs about management. Complete these sentences:

- Quality is achieved by...
- Productivity improves when...
- The role of management is to...
- Workers perform best when...

- We learn by...

Save your answers. After completing all 14 Points, come back and read them again. See what changed.
