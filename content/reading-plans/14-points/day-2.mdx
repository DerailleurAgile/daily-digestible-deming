# Day 1: Create Constancy of Purpose

## Opening: The Pivot Problem

Sarah's startup had pivoted three times in eighteen months. First they were a B2C app, then enterprise software, now they were exploring blockchain solutions. Each pivot came with layoffs, scrambled priorities, and exhausted teams rebuilding from scratch.

At the latest all-hands, a veteran engineer asked: "What are we actually trying to accomplish?" 

The CEO pointed to the mission statement on the wall: "Empowering businesses through innovative technology." It sounded inspiring. But the team knew the real answer: survival. Whatever would get them to the next funding round. Whatever investors currently found exciting.

The stated aim was innovation. The actual aim was not dying this quarter.

Meanwhile, the entire organization was drowning in the problems of *today*—bugs to fix, features to ship, fires to fight, pitches to prepare. No one was thinking about tomorrow. No one was building anything that would last.

The gap between what they *said* they were doing and what they were *actually* optimizing for had become a chasm.

## Point 1: Create Constancy of Purpose

**Deming's words:**

> "Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs."

This is Deming's first point—and it's first for a reason. Without constancy of purpose, everything else falls apart.

**Two kinds of problems:**

Deming identified two categories of problems every organization faces:

1. **Problems of today** - Maintaining current quality, meeting today's sales, managing budgets, handling immediate issues
2. **Problems of tomorrow** - Staying in business, maintaining competitive position, providing jobs in the future

Most organizations are consumed by problems of today. They become incredibly efficient at fighting fires, meeting quotas, hitting this quarter's numbers. But efficiency in the wrong direction is still failure.

**The trap:**

It's easy—and comfortable—to stay "bound up in the tangled knot of the problems of today," as Deming put it. These problems are concrete, measurable, urgent. They demand attention *now*.

Problems of tomorrow are different. They require:
- Long-term thinking
- Investment without immediate return
- Faith that there will be a future
- Commitment that transcends quarterly results

**The key question:**

Are your leaders dedicated to quick profits, or to constancy of purpose? The next quarterly dividend isn't as important as whether your organization exists 10, 20, or 30 years from now.

## Extended Teaching: What Constancy of Purpose Requires

Constancy of purpose isn't passive—it demands specific commitments. Deming outlined three core obligations:

**1. Innovate**

Allocate resources for long-term planning. This means genuine investment in:
- Research and development
- New products and services that will help people live better
- Understanding what new skills and capabilities you'll need
- Planning for materials, production methods, and costs you'll face tomorrow

Innovation requires faith that there will be a future. Without top management's unshakable commitment to quality and productivity, everyone else will be skeptical about investing effort in tomorrow.

**2. Invest in people**

Put resources into:
- Research
- Education
- Training and retraining
- Development of new skills

Your people are your future. Starving their development to meet today's numbers is eating your seed corn.

**3. Never stop improving**

Constantly improve the design of product and service. This obligation never ceases. The consumer is the most important part of the production line.

Here's the critical insight: **You can be incredibly efficient at making the wrong thing.** It's entirely possible to go out of business while everyone performs with devotion, using every modern method to boost efficiency—if you're making what the market no longer needs.

**The commitment matters:**

Your customers, suppliers, and employees need your statement of constancy of purpose. They need to know you intend to stay in business by providing something valuable, not just extracting profit until the well runs dry.

Deming even suggested: "Top management should publish a resolution that no one will lose his job for contribution to quality and productivity." This signals commitment. It says improvement matters more than short-term convenience.

## Reflection Questions

1. **What percentage of your organization's energy goes to "problems of today" versus "problems of tomorrow"?** Is anyone actually working on tomorrow?

2. **When did your organization last invest in genuine innovation**—not just incremental features, but rethinking what you do and why?

3. **Does your organization invest in developing people for capabilities you'll need in the future?** Or only for skills you need right now?

4. **If you stopped innovating today and just maintained current products/services, how long would you survive?** 2 years? 5 years? 10?

5. **Have your leaders ever articulated why your organization should exist 20 years from now?** Beyond "making money," what's the purpose?

## Daily Challenge

**Identify the imbalance:**

Today, make two lists:

**Problems of Today** (that consumed time this week):
- What fires did you fight?
- What immediate pressures did you respond to?
- What "urgent" things demanded attention?

**Problems of Tomorrow** (that got any attention):
- What did anyone do to prepare for next year? Next decade?
- What investments in innovation, research, or education happened?
- What long-term improvements were made?

Look at the ratio. Most organizations are 95% today, 5% tomorrow. That's the problem Deming saw everywhere.

The first step to constancy of purpose is seeing how little of it you actually have.
