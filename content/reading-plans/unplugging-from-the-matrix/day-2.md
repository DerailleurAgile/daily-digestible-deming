# Day 2: The Illusion—Faulty Practices & Deadly Diseases

## Seeing the Code

In *The Matrix*, once Neo begins training, he learns to see the green code behind the illusion. Similarly, once you know what to look for, you'll start seeing Deming's faulty practices and deadly diseases everywhere.

**Deming's Nine Faulty Practices** (from *The New Economics*):
1. **Lack of constancy of purpose** - Shifting priorities, quarterly thinking, management by crisis
2. **Emphasis on short-term profits** - Sacrificing long-term health for immediate numbers
3. **Personal review systems, merit rating, annual review** - Ranking people, forced distributions
4. **Mobility of management** - Job-hopping leaders who never see the consequences of their decisions
5. **Management by use of visible figures only** - Ignoring the unknown and unknowable factors
6. **Excessive medical costs** - Healthcare expenses that cripple competitiveness
7. **Excessive costs of liability** - Legal costs from adversarial relationships
8. **Focus on the denominator** - Cutting costs rather than improving value
9. **Overemphasis on testing and inspection** - Finding defects instead of preventing them

**The Seven Deadly Diseases** include:
- Lack of constancy of purpose
- Emphasis on short-term profits
- Performance appraisals and merit ratings
- Mobility of top management
- Running a company on visible figures alone
- Excessive medical costs
- Excessive warranty costs

**Why are these problematic?** Because they all share a common flaw: **they treat the organization as a collection of independent parts rather than an interdependent system.** They assume:
- People work independently (they don't—they work in systems)
- Individual performance can be isolated (it can't—performance is largely determined by the system)
- Past results predict future performance (they don't—systems change)
- More pressure produces better results (it doesn't—it produces fear and sub-optimization)

These practices persist because they provide the *illusion* of control. They're simple, visible, and satisfy our desire to "do something." But like the Matrix, they blind us to how things actually work.

## Reflection Questions
1. Which of these faulty practices exist in your organization? How many can you count?
2. What would happen if you stopped doing one of them? What fear prevents you from stopping?

## Today's Challenge
Identify one "deadly disease" or "faulty practice" in your workplace. Write down: (1) Why you think it exists, (2) What problem it's meant to solve, (3) What problems it actually creates.
